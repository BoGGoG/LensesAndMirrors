Inkscape pictures
==================================

The figures ending with `.svg` are made with Inkscape and can be edited with it.
The corresponding `.pdf_tex` files have been exported from Inkscape to be used
with LaTeX.
It is shown in the files themselves how to use them, keep in mind that if you
have them in a folder `figures` you have to change the filepaths to `figures/`.
